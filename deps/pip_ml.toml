# [[dependency]]                           # Toml way to define array of objects.
# python = "../_build/target-deps/python"  # Path to python used to install. Absolute or relative to this config.
# packages = ["numpy==1.23.5"]                     # Array of packages to install, they all will be passed directly to pip.
# target = "../_build/target-deps/numpy"   # Folder to install into.   Absolute or relative to this config.
# platforms = ["windows-x86_64"]           # Platform(s) to filter, default is ["*"].
# download_only = true                     # Do pip download instead of install, gets a whl file that can be installed later.

# !!!
# IMPORTANT: If you change this config cleanup target folder. Script check that it already exists and does nothing.


# Options. 
# Various options are available that are passed through pip during the installation.

# download_only: Only download the pip package, do not install it.
# install_dependencies: When set to False, dependencies of a pip package will not be downloaded or installed
# append_to_install_folder: When set to true and the target directory already exists, these packages will be appended to the existing folder.
# build_isolated: Sets `--isolated` for pip install when installing. This means that environment variables and user settings will be ignored.
# add_python_to_lib_path: Will set --global-options to include Python's lib and include folders when running the pip install. 
#    Useful when a python pip package has a C extension that needs to bind to Python. Setting this to true will set build_isolated to False.
